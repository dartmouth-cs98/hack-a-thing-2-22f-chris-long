# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

[Deployed Website](https://chris-long-website.onrender.com/)

I built a personal website using the ThreeJS module. My main goal with this project was learning ThreeJS, not simple static web development. I created two iterations of the page. First was from a YouTube Tutorial. It contained a rotation tourus, a cube with my photo mapped to it, and a basketball. As you scrolled the camera moved out making everything shrink while the HTML stayed fixed. The second iteration was inspired by a example I found where the author made a live cloud nebula in the background that appeared to contain lightning.

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

I worked on this project by myself.

## What you learned
The package is very powerful from top to bottom. Simple ThreeJS setup is pretty straightforward, but as you add in more complexity it can be difficult to understand perspectives and camera locations that are at play. Lighting is also difficult to keep track of because the end results don't usually line up intuition. I envision more and more corporate websites will utilize this package (many already do), but becoming really effective with tool still takes some experience.
